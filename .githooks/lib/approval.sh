# approval.sh — reviewer approval flag validation.
#
# ONE implementation, used by both enforcement layers:
#   Layer 1  .claude/helpers/hook-handler.cjs  (PreToolUse, advisory, gitignored)
#   Layer 2  .githooks/pre-commit              (git hook, gates the commit)
#
# Layer 1 is gitignored, so it can never be shipped or reviewed. Previously each
# layer reimplemented these checks, and keeping them in agreement was manual: the
# two drifted on leading whitespace, on interior whitespace, on parseInt leniency,
# and on whether a UTF-8 BOM counts as whitespace. Every one of those was a case
# where the advisory layer accepted a flag the gate rejected, or vice versa. Sourcing
# this file from both makes parity structural instead of maintained.
#
# Usage — sourced:
#     source "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.githooks/lib/approval.sh"
#     reviewer_validate_approval "$APPROVAL_FILE" "$TIMEOUT" || exit 1
#
# Usage — executed (how Layer 1 calls it):
#     bash .githooks/lib/approval.sh check [approval_file] [timeout]
#     # exit 0 = valid, 1 = rejected. Messages on stdout/stderr.
#
# APPROVAL FLAG FORMAT (v2):
#
#     <unix-timestamp> <index-fingerprint>
#
# The fingerprint binds the approval to the exact staged content. Without it the
# gate only ever answered "did someone approve recently", never "did someone approve
# THIS" — so any unconsumed flag authorised whatever happened to be staged next.
# That is not hypothetical: a reviewer issuing a flag and the agent then restaging
# produces a commit that looks approved and was not.
#
# v1 flags (bare timestamp) are REJECTED, not grandfathered. An accepted v1 flag is
# the same hole wearing a different hat, and the reviewer agent is the component that
# writes the flag — so this is a coordinated upgrade, not a third-party break. The
# remedy is one step: re-run the reviewer.

# Colours: honour the caller's if sourced, define them if executed standalone.

# Fingerprint the git index — i.e. exactly what a commit would record.
#
# `git ls-files -s | git hash-object --stdin` rather than `git write-tree`:
# write-tree creates tree objects in the object database as a side effect, and this
# runs on every commit attempt from a PreToolUse hook, where a read should not
# mutate anything. hash-object without -w writes nothing. Verified byte-stable
# across repeated invocations, and it changes when the staged set changes and
# returns to its prior value when a file is unstaged.
reviewer_index_fingerprint() {
    # `-C <root>`, `--full-name` and the `:/` pathspec are all load-bearing. Bare
    # `git ls-files -s` is scoped to the current directory subtree and prints paths
    # RELATIVE to cwd, so the fingerprint would depend on where it was invoked from.
    # The git hook runs at the repo root, but the PreToolUse handler uses
    # process.cwd(), which need not be. Worse than a mismatch: from a subdirectory
    # the fingerprint would cover only that subtree, so staging a file anywhere else
    # would not invalidate the approval — defeating the whole point of binding.

# Trim leading and trailing whitespace only, matching JS .trim() semantics.
#
# $(cat) alone strips just trailing newlines, so a leading space survives into the
# regex and fails it. `tr -d '[:space:]'` overcorrects the other way: it also strips
# INTERIOR whitespace, so "1788 387445" would collapse into a valid-looking
# timestamp. Both were real divergences between the two layers.

# reviewer_validate_approval <approval_file> <timeout_seconds> [consume]
#   consume=1 (default) — on success the flag is deleted, so one approval buys one
#                         commit. This is what the git hook wants.
#   consume=0           — validate without deleting. Layer 1 runs BEFORE git commit,
#                         so if it consumed the flag the commit that follows would
#                         fail with "no approval found". An advisory check must not
#                         destroy the thing the gate is about to check.
#
#   0 = approved
#   1 = rejected. A rejected flag is ALWAYS deleted regardless of `consume`: it is
#       invalid, and leaving it on disk lets it be silently retried.
